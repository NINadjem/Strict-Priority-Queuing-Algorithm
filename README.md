# Strict Priority Queuing Algorithm 🕥 📏 ✔️

 This is a simple implementation of the Strict Priority Queuing Algorithm that is actually used in scheduling...
 
 well it's also a part of our miserable practical work so I thought that it would be a nice thing to share...
 
 ## I/O of the Algorithm  
 
 * input  : an Array that contiens times ( as doubles ) 🕖 and their waiting lists ( as a char list ). 📜
 
 * output : an Array that contiens token elements ( as a char ) 🆎 
            with their relative time of end of execution ( as double ) 🕣.
 
 Well, I know that what this isn't clear enough, that's why there are some screenshots i👇 👇 👇 👇 👇 👇
